##### DISCLAIMER : THIS ISNT A DOC. I ONLY MENTION ABOUT WHAT THE COPIER DID TO ME (AND MY FRIEND(s) A BIT). MY GRAMMAR IS NOT GOOD, SO I STRUGGLED TO WRITE RIGHT.

#### Hi, ill be telling something im uncomfortable with. and ill explain what did fang do, ( aka @yahoofangs ). and why i writed this down here. 

## The first copying they did.

basically, i dont even know you fang. i heard you were a problematic person, and a copier/w out perms. whatever, i had an old connie i always wear, and a new connie with same stuff almost with the old one and fang made an connie, then after some days i saw fang on, with a similiar connie, firstly i maked sure if it was really fang, he took inspo of me without permission and yes, i was pretty sure bc its the same even if its not a big inspo of me. thought i never want people to copy/take inspo of me without permission. this is the proof, for fang that says "i didnt took inspo/copy anything!!"

first i accepted your apologize, fang. 

### second, they copied my PERSONALITY, note it to your mind.

after one day the time i made this readme, again. i will never even listen to fang after this. its enough bc i never got copied, atleast not even my personality before, even they tagged me and my some friends on their bio. no one gived permission to you fang. im not comfortable with you copying anything, ANYTHING about me my friends or tagging me on your bio! so please.

" i didnt copy anything abt u!! i dont wanna have enemies like you!!" 
yeah. then they started copying my personality (my humor first) in a day, and i didnt even say anything. SPEECHLESS. i finded it out myself while i was ontab, when i changed to a skin fang copied the face on a glisten pony, saying "pls speed i need this.." "my mom is kind of homeless" which i did a sec ago while i was with my friends, yes its not same yet but they do it after me, like stalking or copying personality, stealing lines is not something nice right? fang said it right after i say the same thing and my friends sun say one w different line. even they copied sum lines my friend use which is their line. (sun / @fieldofstrawberries) thats it for now ig.
